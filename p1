I am a firm believer of the fact that technology is the most liberating and impactful skill. Technological innovations have helped mankind during the toughest of times and it has to be one of easiest ways to make lives better.

Currently working with Oracle as a Senior Applications Engineer in Oracle Applications lab. Very grateful to have an opportunity in an organisation responsible for running all the applications that run Oracle. We investigate how new technologies can be applied to enterprise applications and we drive the business transformations that allow Oracle to continue to succeed.

During my tenure at Oracle I experienced developing multi-tier cloud applications using web-based technologies like Spring MVC and Spring Boot. Also experienced designing and developing actionable BI solutions that provided insights to users by extracting, data modelling, and integrating data from different sources. I was also responsible for front-end development,Database Design to support business requirements for reporting across the organisation.

Previously I worked as a Business analyst in Amazon working in the Last mile data science team where we worked on enhancing the delivery experience for out customers by developing the tools which helped Amazon to complete the delivery on time. Here my tech stack comprised of Python based libraries and frameworks to predict the geocodes and correct the incorrect addresses.
